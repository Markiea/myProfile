      <h1 id="project"> My Projects</h1>
      <p> <span>http://Markiea.github.io </span>The requirements are:

Your project is responsive to different devices and/or browser sizes and improves the user experience in some way based on what type of device the project is viewed from. The user experience must be improved in some way through your responsive design. See below for clarifications.
Your project includes at least 3 custom-written CSS selectors/rules in a .css file which are applied to your HTML elements
Your project includes custom-written JavaScript including at least one JavaScript function (jQuery is fine as well) located in a .js file
Your code has some comments noting major portions of your code
Your project code is on your GitHub account in its own repository
It must include a README file located at the top level directory of your project that includes a description of your project and - if necessary - any special instructions to run/view your project
You are highly encouraged to include a front-end framework such as AJAX, jQuery, or Angular in your project as a demonstration of your ability to utilize these. However, this is not a requirement of a passing project.
You are also highly encouraged to add some form of user interactivity to your project where something responds to an action the user performs. However, this is also not a requirement of passing.
Have fun! Your project should be something you're proud of and that adequately demonstrates your base knowledge in the concepts you've learned.</p>
